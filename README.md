During this HackMTY, the Biomini team focused on developing an advanced platform based on an algorithm that automates the download of experimental data from ChEMBL, a database with millions of records. The data is then cleaned and preprocessed to convert chemical structures into binary molecular fingerprints, and IC50 power values are transformed to a negative logarithmic scale (pIC50). Various Machine Learning models are trained and the best one is selected based on its metrics to evaluate a dataset of molecules, identifying the most promising ones as potential drug candidates (with higher pIC50 potency). In addition, the platform allows users to upload their own CSV files for customized predictions.
Among the advantages of the platform are its free availability, making it accessible to all at no cost. In addition, being open source, the source code is publicly available, allowing users to review, modify and contribute to the development of the software. It also stands out for its constant updating, ensuring that the platform incorporates improvements and new 
functionalities on a regular basis.
